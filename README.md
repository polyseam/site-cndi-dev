# cndi.dev

[cndi.dev](https://cndi.dev) was originally built on Webflow and is being
rewritten in Deno using the
[Fresh framework](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started).

The `main` branch is hosted at [cndi-dev.deno.dev](https://cndi-dev.deno.dev).

### Usage

Make sure to install Deno: https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation

Then start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
